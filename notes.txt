get new will need to be updated to add the uid to new transactions

need to backload all transactions with uid

then need to use uid to get transactions

also need to do update refresh logic
- it's getting slow, kinda painful to reload everything just because you're hitting the page again
- basically I need to implement it as 
	- on first load, pull new transactions
	- after, during session, only pull new transactions on pull down to refresh
